Summary \u00b6 This directory contains a Dockerfile that modifies the official MediaWiki docker container. Before launching the container, it specifies /var/www/html as a mounted volume, and it copies LocalSettings.php , the MediaWiki config file, from this repo into the container. See d-mysql repo . Also see pod-charlesreid1 for a working pod using this container. Docker Compose \u00b6 To use this container as part of a pod, as with the charlesreid1.com wiki, see pod-charlesreid1-wiki . Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you are seeing 404s on every page you try, it may be because your MediaWiki config file is set to redirect you to /wiki/Main_Page but your web server is not set up to handle it. See this lin and the guide for apache and nginx . Updating Settings \u00b6 The LocalSettings.php file must be copied into the container, because we will end up bind-mounting the entire MediaWiki directory when the container is run and we can't bind-mount a file inside a bind-mounted directory. Thus, to update LocalSettings.php, skins, or extensions, you will need to re-make the Docker container. Use the make rules to remake the Docker container: make clean make build make run Submodule \u00b6 The submodule charlesreid1-config/ contains configuration files for both MediaWiki and Apache. See the wiki/charlesreid1-config repo for details. To clone the submodule when you clone the repo, include the --recursive flag: git clone --recursive https://git.charlesreid1.com/docker/d-mediawiki.git To check out the submodule after a shallow clone: git submodule init # or git submodule update --init To fetch changes to the submodule from the submodule's remote: git submodule update --remote","title":"Home"},{"location":"#d-mediawiki","text":"This is the MediaWiki docker container used to run MediaWiki on charlesreid1.com/wiki .
